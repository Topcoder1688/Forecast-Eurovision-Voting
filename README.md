Forecast voting for Eurovision Song Contest

The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual competition broadcast worldwide which is open to entrants from active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

This is not defined by Europe's geographical bounds; for example Israel and Cyprus compete in the contest. This year's contest is being held in Oslo, Norway. The location is usually the country of the previous year's winner. The number of entrants changes on a yearly basis, due to flux in EBU Membership, political shifts such as dissolution of the Former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and desire (or lack thereof) of countries to participate.

Each country must submit one song to represent it, which must not have been previously commercially released. All songs are, however, made public by a deadline several weeks before the contest, and this year's entrants are all known already with details such as title, language and artist included in the database provided. Since 1999 songs may be sung in any language , whereas prior to this point (upto 1998 exclusive) songs had to be sung in one of the entrant country's national languages.

Although the voting format has changed over time, the modern positional voting system has been in place since 1975. Voting countries award scores of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 and 12 allocated to the favourite song. Each score can only be awarded once; ie: each voting country can only allocate scores to 10 countries, with all other countries automatically allocated a score of 0. These scores are then added up to determine a competitor's final score. No country can vote for itself.

Although mass televoting has been the primary mode of final voting since its implementation in 1998, each country also has a back-up jury in the event of failure of the televoting system. Some countries also supplement televotes with sms votes.

Despite the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, the four same countries - Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and France - automatically qualify for the final each year. This means that they do not compete in the semi-final. Additionally, the host country - this year, Norway - is also exempted from performing in the semi-final, automatically qualifying for the final. However, these five countries do vote in the semi-final, specifically France, Germany and Spain in semi-final 1, and United Kingdom and Norway in semi-final 2 this year.
